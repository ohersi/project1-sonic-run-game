# Sonic Run Game

Top down endless runner game where the player controls Sonic trying to avoid obstacles. First project of the PerScholas course. 


## Demo

## Lessons Learned

Understanding the fundamentals of javascript and implmenting them into an game. Learned about callback functions, DOM manipulation, timers, animations, localStorage, JSON. Some challenges I came across were getting the collision and speed of the obstacles right.

## Roadmap

- fix background stuttering 
- fix DOMException error when start page loads ("play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first.")
